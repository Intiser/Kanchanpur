          While each of these notable figures made unique contributions in their own time and context, they share a common thread: a commitment to serving their community and upholding the spiritual and ethical values established by our founder, Hazrat Shah Miran.
        </p>
        
        <p class="mb-6">
          From spiritual guidance to educational reform, from land stewardship to political advocacy, these individuals adapted the core mission of service to the needs of their era. Their diverse approaches demonstrate the family's adaptability while maintaining consistent values across centuries.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Today, new generations continue this legacy in fields ranging from education and public service to cultural preservation and humanitarian work. While their methods may differ from their ancestors, the underlying commitment to making a positive difference in their communities remains constant.

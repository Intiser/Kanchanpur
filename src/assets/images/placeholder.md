# Image Placeholders

This directory will contain images for the website. For the initial implementation, we're using placeholder images from Pexels.

In a production environment, this would be populated with:

- Historical photos of the estate
- Portraits of notable figures
- Images of historical documents
- Contemporary photos of historical sites
